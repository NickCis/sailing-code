# Sailing code

A blog with experiences of developing with SailfishOS.

I've decided to start this blog in order leave some notes of how i sorted out several problems that i came across while developing with Sailfish OS. The articles may have errors (and if you find them, please correct them or make me known about them!), and may only reflect my point of view. But they could be an map when sailing in the unknown sea of Sailfish OS.

The template used by the blog is [Pixyll Jekyll theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) (see the project for its licence).
